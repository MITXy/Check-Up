# Check-Up: Automobile ðŸš”Recognition Software

Check-Up is an AI-powered automobile recognition software designed for ascertaining the physical structure of Automobile vehicles. It identifies vehicles from image inputs and assigns an insurance rating based on predefined criteria. In future releases, the model will support additional features, larger datasets, and more advanced models.

---
## Features

- **Vehicle Recognition**: Identifies the make, model, and year of a car from uploaded images.
- **Insurance Rating**: Calculates a rating based on the vehicle's attributes.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a user-friendly, interactive web interface.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for future enhancements like damage assessment and multilingual support.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.8  
- Required libraries: Streamlit, TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas.
- A modern GPU is recommended for faster image processing.

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/automobile-recognition
   cd automobile-recognition
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install all the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the Pre-Trained Model**
   Download the pre-trained model file (if not included in the repository) from [insert link or instructions] and place it in the `models` directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir models
   mv downloaded_model_file.h5 models/
   ```

5. **Run the Streamlit Application**
   Start the Streamlit interface:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The application will launch in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Directory Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
Check-Up/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                   # Main Streamlit application file
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                  # Directory for pre-trained models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ model.h5             # Pre-trained model file
â”œâ”€â”€ static/                  # Static assets (e.g., sample images)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt         # List of required libraries
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ utils/                   # Helper functions and scripts
    â”œâ”€â”€ image_processing.py  # Pre-processing scripts for images
    â””â”€â”€ model_utils.py       # Functions for model inference
```

## Usage Guide

### Streamlit Interface
1. Launch the Streamlit app with the command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. Use the interface to upload images of vehicles.
3. The application will display:
   - Vehicle details such as make, model, and year.
   - A calculated insurance rating.

---

## Future Plans

1. **Real-Time Damage Assessment**
   - Detect and evaluate visible damage on vehicles.
2. **Integration with Insurance Databases**
   - Automatically match vehicle details with historical insurance data.
3. **Enhanced Visualizations**
   - Add advanced data visualization for insurance trends and predictions.
4. **Mobile App Development**
   - Launch a mobile-friendly version for on-the-go users.

---

## Testing

To ensure the application works as expected, follow these steps:

1. Install `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

Test cases include validating the Streamlit interface, model accuracy, and API responses.

## Limitations

- **Image Quality:** Recognition may falter with low-resolution or blurry images.
- **Model Scope:** Currently limited to a predefined set of vehicle types and years.
- **Performance:** GPU processing is recommended for faster performance.
